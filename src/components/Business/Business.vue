                Computational Business Opportunities
            </h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                The computational revolution is just beginning in business. 
                However, it must be integrated with a similar computational 
                revolution in accounting and finance. If any lesson can be drawn 
                from the latest scandals in business it is that the old ideas of 
                accounting and finance are incapable of describing the financial 
                results of modern practices.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                A few months ago I saw an advertisement  in the Wall Street 
                Journal that proclaimed:
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                <mark>
                    "Your aversion to calculus will be overcome by your desire for money."
                </mark>
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                This is a clear declaration by a business entity of what is 
                needed in the new business environment.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                My concern is that with such clear declarations by business and 
                the understanding that we live in a knowledge based economy in 
                which computers are ubiquitous, why are so few students enrolled 
                in mathematics and science?
