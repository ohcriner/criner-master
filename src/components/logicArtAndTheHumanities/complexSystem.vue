                The 21<sup>st</sup> century is the beginning of an era where many more of 
                the things we wish to understand are no longer simple, linear, or 
                straight forward; they are nonlinear, complex, and chaotic. The  
                nature of this non-linearity and complexity is just now coming 
                into the focus th of scientific knowledge and human 
                consciousness. In the past, non-linear behavior were "assumed" 
                away in the analyses of scientists and mathematicians because 
                they caused the problem to be intractable and beyond the 
                capabilities of the available tools, i.e., the equations 
                could not be solved. Today, we do not need to solve equations in 
                the traditional sense; we have computers. Computers enable us to 
                "solve" many more "problems" than could even be conceived 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               The usual method of discourse between human beings is through 
               spoken and written language. Theories and explanations are 
               sequences of sentences that establish step-by-step reasons, 
               sentences leading to  finals sentence that is called conclusions. 
               Most knowledge that is socially accepted is sequential knowledge; 
               it is straight-forward, linear, step-by-step and simple. 
               Sequential knowledge is all knowledge that can be written down in 
               sequences of characters like this sentence. This class of things, 
               i.e., sentences, constitutes the literature of the world. By 
               definition, what is meant by "the literature" is the class of 
               objects made up of sentences. The assumption that all of reality 
               can be described utilizing these sentences is a gigantic leap of 
               faith held by most people. This sentence structure is very 
               limiting, indeed. However, this paradigm is so widely accepted 
               that most people believe that all phenomena can be explained. 
               Most people believe that if it cannot be written down, i.e., 
               cannot be described or cannot find it in a book, then it is not 
               knowledge.

                ONE MAN'S WITCHCRAFT IS ANOTHER MANâ€™S SCIENCE. 
            </h4>
            <p class="left-align">
                There are great similarities between witchcraft and science and 
                engineering. By witchcraft, I do not mean devil worship, 
                Satanism or black magic. Witchcraft is knowledge that does not 
                fall into the sequential model which we have described. In this 
                sense, most of art would be witchcraft. Classical music would 
                still be knowledge, but much of the blues, jazz and rock would be 
                witchcraft. One of the characteristics of the blues and jazz is 
                that they cannot be written down completely. Witchcraft is only 
                another view of reality that is different from that which is 
                socially accepted in your community as knowledge. It was 
                fashionable at one time to refer to a particular theory of 
                economics as "Voodoo economics", meaning an economic theory that 
                I do not understand and believe to be some form of absurdity that 
                it may as well be "black magic." Clearly the people who coined 
                the term did not understand Voodoo. Consider, for example. that 
                contemporary European American society gives credibility to 
                abstract art by the intimidation of its chosen literary art 
                critics. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 These critics write about music and painting or sculpture as 
                 though they definitively understood the purpose of every brush 
                 stroke, chisel notch, or grace note and had the context with 
                 which to make everything understood. They have created a 
                 literature of criticism and artistic theory. But there is no 
                 sequential understanding of modern abstract art despite the 
                 number of critical essays written about it. The sequential 
                 context of language has no capability for analysis for things 
                 that do not have sequential structure. Essentially, all that 
                 can be said is I like it or I don't like it. From this 
                 perspective art criticism is some kind of absurdity. I often 
                 wondered why Nat Hentoff had so much to say about jazz. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Modern abstract art has no social function in western 
                 civilization, other than to bring ineffable unexplainable 
                 aesthetic appreciation. It has very little meaning in the 
                 social fabric of society. It is not a part of any cultural or 
                 national ritual of inclusion. It does not recall our history in 
                 a stylized mnemonic for the griouxs. Traditional African art is 
                 abstract in origin as is most art of traditional nonwestern 
                 societies. Unfortunately, the social function of the traditional 
                 art of so-called primitive peoples is lost or is rapidly being 
                 lost as western civilization spreads across the remnants of 
                 traditional civilizations. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Music and sculpture, of all the arts, show most vividly the 
                 difference between sequential and non-sequential knowledge 
                 systems. Literature and drama are fundamentally sequential 
                 forms and show the linear context, although writers and artists 
                 like James Joyce, August Strinberg, Eugene Ionesco, Samuel 
                 Beckett,  and others who  appear to have intuitively understood 
                 the linear straightjacket that the writer is in. They all 
                 attempted to get beyond sequential limitations in their work to 
                 get out of the box, if you will. Joyce's Fennagin's Wake 
                 destroys the formal structure of the novel and the language as 
                 he strives to get beyond the constraints of language and nature. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 In drama, the "dream plays" of Strinberg and Ibsen and the 
                 "Theater of the Absurd" of Ionesco and Beckett were also 
                 attempts to get beyond the boundary of sequential thought and 
                 to include the psychological and the illogical, but to no avail. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 In music, Arnold Schoenberg realized the limitation of the 
                 sequential system in eighteenth century European music theory 
                 and attempted to broaden it with his twelve-tone system and he 
                 created yet another sequential system. Schoenberg's system 
                 legitimized the use of strong dissonance in European style 
                 classical music. Although Bach, Beethoven, and others had used 
                 dissonance as spice, in Schoenberg's music, it became the main 
                 course. But, just as in sculpture, the abstraction didn't work 
                 until the African touched it. John Coltrane was one of the most 
                 brilliant musicians of the twentieth century and he made strong 
                 dissonance work and be accepted socially. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 The relationship between art and science is at the boundary of 
                 that knowledge expressible in sequential form and that which is 
                 not. It is the complexity of knowledge that causes people to 
                 dismiss it condescendingly as an art. Computer programming is 
                 still "an art" and the new parallel machines are challenging 
                 software developers to think in non-sequential modes, or , 
                 rather, multi-sequential modes. Classical musicians normally 
                 think multi-sequentially. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 One often hears about the healing arts, the medical arts, or the 
                 art of management. These are merely expressions of the inability 
                 to express this knowledge in the sequential form required by the 
                 present scientific methods. They are expressions of our 
                 inability to effectively deal with complexity. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Complex systems are more recognizable today because of our 
                 attempts to do very complex things with high technology. 
                 Environmental science is an extremely complex subject, but some 
                 knowledge is obvious even there. As a high school student, 
                 I knew that the smoke being belched into the sky by the smoke 
                 stacks, chemical plants, and refineries around Houston would 
                 soon come back to haunt us. My high school chemistry teacher 
                 gave me the hint when he burned some sulfur and caught the smoke 
                 in a jar, added some water to the jar, shook it up and tested 
                 the water for acidity. I don't know how many millions of dollars 
                 have been spent on research to "prove" the existence and affect 
                 of acid rain, but my chemistry teacher's little experiment and a 
                 little intuitive knowledge should have been enough. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Complex systems are all around us and especially in the 
                 environment and ecology. Complex systems are said to behave 
                 counter-intuitively. What that really means is that their 
                 behavior is not as expected or predicted by simple linear 
                 theories. Or, if the theories do apply, the logic is too 
                 difficult to be handled with the mathematics and computing 
                 available. This leads me to express strong caution about the 
                 uses and limitations of scientific based decisions in the 
                 context of complex nonlinear phenomena. The variations of 
                 nonlinearities are virtually endless and the occurrence of 
                 chaotic behavior is not predictable. Couple this with the 
                 Godellean limitations of logical systems and the logical 
                 paradigm of language fails to be an adequate scientific method.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Let us examine the extremes of application of the present 
                 scientific methods based upon analysis and synthesis and the 
                 reductionist assumption of science. I believe that the life 
                 process is one thing with which science should not tamper. 
                 When I say the life process, I am referring to the creation 
                 of life and the modification of its essential control devices -- 
                 genes. I think it is important to understand the gene, and how 
                 it influences the development of the organism, but the 
                 intentional modification of the genetic material of human beings 
                 is a most dangerous practice. I say this because, as a systems 
                 engineer, I am aware of the behavior of complex systems. They 
                 behave strangely and counter-intuitively and sequential analysis 
                 may not give sufficient understanding of the systems behavior. 
                 The gene structure of life is a very complex system and its 
                 long-term behavior is unpredictable with the knowledge we have 
                 today.

                 There has developed a practice of creating new animal organisms 
                 and patenting these animals to profit from this technology. One 
                 can imagine what could have happened if this technology had been 
                 available in the early 19th century. Recombinant DNA technology 
                 is making it possible to design living organisms to one 
                 specifications and the law permits the patent so that profits 
                 are assured. This issue is especially intriguing because it 
                 illustrates the degree to which the technology has outstripped 
                 the Eighteenth century European conceptualizations of reality, 
                 ethics, and religion. The technologies are developing much 
                 faster than the concepts of philosophy and theology. The 
                 traditional adolescent problems of "being" and "who am I" 
                 may soon be encountered by a new machine, or, perhaps, a new 
                 animal creature. It is quite conceivable that Descartes' cogito 
                 ergo sum, "I think, therefore I am," will be uttered by this 
                 new machine and shake the foundations of western civilization

                 We are on the verge of making a machine that thinks, 
                 understands, feels, is creative, and does many things previously 
                 thought to be reserved for human beings. It may become difficult 
                 to distinguish between this machine and a human being. It is 
                 clear that the perspectives of these artificially intelligent 
                 devices will be oriented toward European perspectives, since 
                 there are almost no African American people active in this 
                 level of complex systems research, theoretical or computational 
                 biology, computer science, artificial intelligence or cognitive 
                 science research. Herein lies the potential for changes in the 
                 social and political systems that could make the twenty-first 
                 century very different for black people.

                 The new recombinant DNA technology will soon make it possible to 
                 manufacture a number of human hormonal growth factors. 
                 These synthetic hormones can be used to alter the development 
                 of living organisms. It would be possible to alter the growth 
                 and development of human beings by administering hormones. What 
                 would you like your child to be? A basketball player, then give 
                 him hormones for growth and physical development. Consider what 
                 would happen it the professional athletic companies obtained a 
                 patient on the growth factors for the optimal configuration of 
                 the athlete. If you want an Einstein, then administer hormones 
                 to enhance memory. If your unborn child is diagnosed to be 
                 anticephallic, then its organs will be harvested for medical 
                 purposes.  For black people the potential for mischief from 
                 genetic engineering far surpass the domesticated breeding, 
                 lynching, torture or any of the other horrors of which 
                 plantation owners could dream.

                It seems clear to me that the current philosophical foundations 
                of society are grossly incapable of addressing contemporary 
                issues concerning the use and limitations of science and 
                technology. Political and religious leaders are confused and 
                cannot reconcile single parent families, surrogate motherhood, 
                homosexuality, gay marriage, and serial, polyandrous, or 
                polygamous marriage with their teachings. How will they ever 
                address genetic engineering? These problems lie embedded in the 
                major dichotomy of western philosophy, the old mind-body problem, 
                again. The mind-body dichotomy has led to the separation between 
                science and the arts and humanities. C. P. Snow described this 
                situation as the "two cultures." If these new technologies are to 
                be mollified and made humane for all people, there must be a 
                reunification of knowledge of science and the humanities; and a 
                new integration of knowledge with the religious.
