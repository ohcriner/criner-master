             In my view mathematics and science are as much an art as are any of 
             the other subjects commonly called "the arts."  Mathematics is very 
             much one of the "humanities" it is one of the most humane arts. No 
             other organism creates mathematics quite like human beings. Bees 
             create hexagonal honeycombs. Birds flock in fluid structures. 
             Mammals live in complex algebraic structures. But, only in human 
             beings has the thought process developed complex organizations and 
             tool making  to hypertropic extremes, i.e., from simple rock drawing 
             to Jackson Pollack.

             Art in non-western societies seems to have had a social purpose. To 
             some European scientists beauty is related to truth. They ascribe 
             almost supernatural properties to the fact that mathematics works,  
             in some simple cases.

              The logic of art  makes art beautiful. Humans are endowed with much 
              more powerful capabilities of analysis that those that can be 
              articulated in language. The logical capacity is part of the biology 
              of the human and it lies in the unconscious autonomous part of the 
              brain's control system.  Recognition of pleasing design, or color 
              composition, or competent performance, or elegant mathematics is a 
              property of the total sensory capacity of the human being.
