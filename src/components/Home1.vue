              This site is intended to help you succeed in college and introduce 
              you to the academic profession. I want to experience the joy of 
              scholarship.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              For me, scholarship is something you do because you must. You have 
              a curosity about all things. You want to know. You want to do. There 
              may be no other reason to study except that you want to know about 
              subject.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Do not confuse higher education with job training. While employment 
              is one outcome of higher education, it should not be the focus of 
              your college career. However, for those who succeed at scholarship, 
              the rewards are very great.
