             Young people rarely understand the value of time and  most behave as 
             though there is enough time to do everything that they want to do.  
             There is very little guidance in colleges that is effective in 
             teaching students the discipline of time management.  Working 
             students are particularly vulnerable to the misuse of time and pay 
             the consequences dearly.

              Working and attending college presents serious problems of 
              management of resources and  responsibilities. When managed badly,  
              this situation usually creates a mental depression in which students 
              settle for mediocrity instead of striving for excellence.

            <p class="left-align">
              Excellence is easier to achieve than most students realize, but is 
              it cannot be achieved if  the financial aid system is not used 
              properly.

              There are only 168 hours in a week.  Let us assume that a student 
              takes a 12 semester full load of courses, lives at home or in an 
              apartment, and works. College courses require time to study and 
              when I was in college the rule of thumb was that a 3 semester-hour 
              course required 3 hours of student preparation for every class 
              contact hour. That means that one 3 semester-hour course was a 
              commitment  of 12 hours per week. Calculus, general physics, and 
              general chemistry were 5 semester hour courses. A 5 semester hour 
              course was a commitment of 20 hours per week. These science courses 
              have been downsized and stretched out  over the last 30 years, but 
              the material is still required over a longer period of study. I 
              personally do not believe that there is much difference between a 
              3 semester-calculus course and a 5 semester-hour calculus course, 
              the process of  learning the calculus is not linear.  In fact, the 
              process of learning any subject is not linear.

              Each course has a rough classification of the number of hours a 
              student should expend in study of that course. Consider  
              the following example:
