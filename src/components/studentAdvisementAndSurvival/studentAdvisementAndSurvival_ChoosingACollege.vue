               Choosing the particular college to attend is one of the least 
               important issues about your higher education.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               Do not be concern about attending a top college that is  rated by 
               the commercial media. Those analyses are simply not conducive to 
               good scholarship and probably waste your money.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               Students can attend almost any <u>accredited</u> college that is 
               affordable, intellectually comfortable, and fits within the 
               family lifestyle and budget of  whoever is supporting your 
               college education.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               The quality of the education that a student gets is more dependent 
               upon the students dedication, drive, and persistence than it is 
               upon the attendance at a "top" university.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               Remember, colleges were not intended for people who work or have 
               other obligations outside of college study. That is a secret that 
               is rarely explicitly stated, but you must know it.  College study 
               must be considered as your primary occupation. To treat your 
               college education as a part-time job outside of your regular work 
               is a grave mistake.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               What makes the 4-year time table so important? For persons who may 
               not be in position to study as their only activity, other plans 
               must be made.  Students should make a written plan for achieving 
               their educational goals that takes into realistic consideration 
               their financial capabilities, then follow that plan as closely as 
               possible.
