            <h5 class="left-align"> Understanding is knowing in context</h5>
            <p class="left-align">
               Of course, now the question becomes, "What is a context?" The 
               teachers job is to establish the context within which to place 
               the knowledge. The process of placing knowledge in a logical 
               context is called explanation.  One of the most common experiences 
               of college students is to have an inspiring lecture in class where 
               the subject matter appears so clear and easy and then to attempt 
               the exercises at a later time and realize that many important 
               pieces of information are forgotten. The exercises seem not to 
               have any bearing on information covered in the lecture. The 
               problem is that the context of the process must also be memorized. 
               The ability to present the argument just as the teacher did must 
               be developed.  Most students fail to see that the context of the 
               presentation is just as important as the facts in the presentation. 
               In fact, it is the context  that makes the facts understandable. 
               The optimal time to review the context and the content of the 
               lecture is immediately after the class. See our discussion on 
               time management.

            <h5 class="left-align"> Some people claim to be good in some subjects but not in others.</h5>
            <p class="left-align">
              Some students believe that they can be good in English but not in 
              mathematics or vice versa. This is a fallacious notion. They are 
              not good in either and that is because they do not understand the 
              context. If they are able to understand the language, then they 
              should be able to understand any subject expressed in the language. 
              That they do not understand the mathematics means that they really 
              cannot read. It is the ability to make inferences in the language 
              that has been missed by many people. It probably was not taught in 
              the first place, because many teachers fail to understand how 
              inferences are made.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               Why shouldn't all subjects be attainable be everyone? The fact is 
               that they should. Everyone should be able to understand any subject.  
               There is no difference between the inferential scheme of an 
               automobile mechanic and that of a nuclear physicist. What is 
               different in these subjects is the vocabulary and process.

               I will return to the following questions later.

               How do you study? When do you study? How long do you study?

               How do you know when you have studied enough?

               Why are college classes spaced and scheduled at such odd times?
