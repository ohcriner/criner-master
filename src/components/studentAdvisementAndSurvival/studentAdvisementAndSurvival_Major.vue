               The conventional  wisdom is that you should major in some field of 
               study that you like or enjoy. There is no doubt that one should 
               enjoy one's work, in some sense, but that is not the criterion 
               that should be used to determine the subjects that should be 
               studied in college.  Most people do not work in the field that 
               they studied in college. This fact should suggest that the idea 
               of a major is overrated.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               There are many virtually useless majors offered in colleges and 
               universities. This is the result of too much specialization and 
               promotion of interests on the part of faculty members. 
               Unfortunately, students rarely learn the truth about the viability 
               of a major subject until they have spent several years studying it.  
               They then have "buyers remorse" and feel that they cannot start 
               over.  This is a false assumption, you can always start over.    
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               There are others who study very viable major subjects but who do 
               not understand  that advanced degrees are required  to be effective, 
               productive, or employable in those fields.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               Still other majors give false impressions that they are lead-ins to 
               another  advanced or professional degree. The  only way to make 
               your  undergraduate education most useful and allow you to be able 
               to go in any direction is to master  the <router-link 
               to="fundamentalsOfKnowledge">fundamentals of knowledge
               </router-link>.  
               These provide you with a well rounded education with which   you 
               are capable of majoring in any subject that you please.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               One way of choosing a major is to study  a subject that few people 
               study.  Mathematics, computer science, and physics  are among the 
               least studied and most in demand subjects.  They are much easier 
               that the popularly believed, but "no pain, no gain." The beauty 
               and joy of this scholarship is not apparent until you have spend 
               considerable time at it.  Clearly, in an information based society, 
               these are among the most viable majors.
