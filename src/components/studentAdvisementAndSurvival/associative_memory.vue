              Memory is an active area of research for neuroscientists, cognitive 
              scientists, mathematicians, computer scientists, neuro-psychologists, 
              neuro-psychiatrists and a host of other scientists. The functions of 
              the brain are indeed a complex process.    
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              In an associative memory, facts are located by association with 
              other facts. In a computer memory facts are located by the address 
              of the location containing it. These two processes are fundamentally 
              different. In the model depicted above, the computer memory has 
              cells or containers in which the facts are stored. If you know the 
              address of the cell, the fact in it is attainable. In the animal 
              memory model, the facts are  stored at the vertices and junctions. 
              The facts are found by traveling along a path to a node or junction. 
              Any fact connected by any path can be found. Facts that do not have 
              connecting paths cannot be found and are said to be forgotten. 
              The brain has the ability to reconnect paths, provided the paths are 
              "close" enough. This is the reason that word mnemonics work in 
              helping to remember facts.
