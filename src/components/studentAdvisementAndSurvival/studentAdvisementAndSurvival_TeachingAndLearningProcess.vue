               Nothing is more confusing to students entering higher education 
               than the answers they get to the  important  questions, if they 
               even ask the  questions. Some students do not know that these 
               questions should be asked.

              These are not rhetorical questions or intended for extended

              concepts,  and methods in your study in college.

            <h5 class="left-align">What is Learning?</h5>
            <p class="left-align">
              Learning is a process of life. Learning occurs when something is 
              done repeatedly over periods of time and in many different ways. 
              Learning is inevitable; if one lives, then one learns, in spite of 
              oneself. Habits are behavior learned inadvertently and are hard to 
              break for that reason.  Physical skills are learned and mental 
              skills are learned the same way, through persistence and practice. 
              Recall learning to ride a bicycle, or how to skateboard, or how to 
              swim. You can never forget how to perform those activities, even 
              though you may fail to be able to perform them  because of the 
              body's physical condition. Similarly learning to speak, sing, or 
              play music are activities that are unforgettable also.  The amazing 
              fact is that all experience is unforgettable, it is simply that we 
              do not know how to locate, i.e., remember, it.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              The variety of ways of engaging a subject to be learned enhances to 
              ability for the brain to locate it.  The brain has an <router-link 
              to="associative_memory">associative memory </router-link> and must 
              make connections with large numbers of events in 
              order to locate the desired process  or facts in memory. This is 
              why human beings mature much more slowly that do other animals. 
              Some animals learn to walk and run very soon after birth. In some 
              organisms, almost everything they need to know for survival is 
              present in the organism at birth. All of the information needed is 
              passed genetically and they know "instinctively" what to do. They 
              need very little nurturing by a parent organism. Parenting and 
              mentoring becomes necessary with animals that developed a cerebral 
              cortex and require external stimulus for learning.  Human beings, 
              some other primates, and other higher animals mature over a much 
              longer time during which they learn survival skills and the 
              responsibilities of life in the group.

              Study methods based upon these assumptions
            </h5>
            <p class="left-align">
              A most effective method for the study of written material is to 
              perform active reading and writing along with other activities. 
              Read the material aloud. That allows you to hear the material. 
              Make detailed written notes, if not copy the material verbatim 
              engages the tactile senses. The study of mathematics and science 
              requires much more detailed written activity than nonscientific 
              subjects. Both reading and writing enhances the memory of the 
              material.
            </p>
            <h5 class="left-align">
              There is only one way to learn and that is through memory.
            </h5>
            <p class="left-align">
               Students must know that many teachers are ambivalent about this 
               view of learning, because they believe that there is more to 
               learning that "rote" memory. They have a romantic notion that 
               human beings are special and different from other animals. Each 
               species of higher animal is different, but each has some kind of 
               brain that helps the organism to perceive the external world and 
               react to it. Within each species, the brain functions the same way, 
               unique to that species. This is clear from the well known fact that 
               dogs have a much more highly developed sense of smell than do human 
               beings.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              I am not ambivalent about the learning process and I hope that you 
              will see why. As a  teacher, I see clearly that my job is to 
              direct you, the student, into the desired activities. Teachers 
              devise activities and exercises for students to perform so that 
              they engage in the activity to be learned repeatedly.  Examine 
              the exercises in any mathematics textbook or music method and 
              you will see this process being implemented.  Teachers cannot 
              force students to perform the learning activities, they can 
              only encourage students and point out the direction to students. 
              It is entirely up to the student to do the work.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              People are usually confused about the functions and operations of 
              the human memory system. It appears to work outside of our 
              consciousness on issues that we present inside our consciousness. 
              The intensity of work toward learning a given process or solving a 
              problem often leads to the activity becoming "second nature", as it 
              were. The result is a demonstration of obvious excellence.  One can 
              only imagine the intensity of practice that Michael Jordan, Tiger 
              Woods, or Maurizio Pollini have experienced. The learning process is 
              the same in art, athletics or academics.

            <h5 class="left-align">
              The relationship between knowing and understanding
            </h5>
            <p class="left-align">
               Knowing is the internalization of the what we have studied and 
               practiced. To be able to regurgitate, as it were, the facts, or 
               repeat  the process, or perform the act demonstrates personal 
               knowledge. The result of the learning process is personal knowledge.  
               Understanding, on the other hand, is quite a different matter. 
               This is at the crux of the confusion that belies our education 
               system.  The simplest way to state it is <router-link 
               to="teaching_learning2">Understanding is Knowing 
               in Context
               </router-link>.
