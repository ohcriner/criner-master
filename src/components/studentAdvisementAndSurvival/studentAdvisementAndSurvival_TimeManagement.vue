              Students rarely think of the physical requirements of scholarship.  
              Study is a physical activity just as is basketball or dancing. 
              It requires physical endurance, stamina, and persistent practice. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              The main outcomes of study are knowledge and understanding. 
              Lets separate the two ideas or knowledge from understanding. This 
              should be easy for I know that there are many things that you know 
              and that you do not understand.       
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              First you must understand the human body as a sensory device and 
              that the brain is the controlling processor. This is a computer 
              analogy of how the body operates.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              There are nerve-ends every one-thousandth of an inch all over the 
              surface of your body. These nerves are continuously transmitting 
              information to your brain, 24/7.  Your brain accepts this 
              information all day and all night, seven days a week. It never 
              stops, for if it stopped you would be dead.       
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Your brain regulates your body. It operates all of the vital organs 
              and regulates blood flow and a myriad of other functions too 
              numerous to name.  It does this regardless of what you think about 
              it. In fact, you are rarely aware of when you brain alters 
              functions in the body.     
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Among the functions that the brain regulates is sleep. Researchers 
              have not found a physical reason for the need to sleep.  
              There may be no physical reason, but there is an operational 
              reason and that is what computer scientists call 
              "garbage collection."  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              In this analogy, the brain functions as the "operating system" for 
              the body. It is collecting information continuously and at some 
              point the capacity of the brain to accept more information reaches 
              its limit.  The brain puts the body into a reduced state of 
              activity and proceeds to rearrange the information that it has 
              stored since the last period of reduced activity. It keeps some 
              information and discards some information to regain sufficient 
              free memory to begin to operate again in a normal state of activity. 
              We call this reduced state of activity sleep and the process of 
              moving the information around appears to us as dreams.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Somehow, the brain is aware of the intensity of our conscious needs 
              in certain processes of interest.  We are, of course, unconscious of 
              the brains awareness.  This is important, because the brain will 
              "cache" certain knowledge if we use it very frequently. A "cache" 
              is a computer science term that means to keep frequently used 
              knowledge close by and easily available.    
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              The brain has another capability also. It is what thinks. I do not 
              know what this thinking process is, but I do not think; my brain 
              thinks and passes the results of that process to my consciousness, 
              the user interface. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              If I want to excel at scholarship, I must optimize the utilization 
              of my brain and provide for it the best environment to do the work 
              I want it to do for me. This means that as an associative memory, 
              my brain needs to have information entered in many different forms, 
              using different methods, and repeatedly often over time.
