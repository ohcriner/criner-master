               The education of our young people is a long term process and 
               should be planned by individual families and not abdicated to the 
               education system.  The school systems cannot do everything that 
               needs to be done and parental involvement is necessary for the 
               successful of an educational plan for young people.  These are 
               some general guidelines on college preparation for parents and 
               prospective college students.

              Children begin to learn  in the womb and learning is continuous 
              throughout life. New knowledge about pre-natal development suggests 
              that the behavior of the mother before birth has a great deal to do 
              with the health and well-being of the child after birth.  However, 
              very old knowledge also appears to be very applicable. Education 
              begins in infancy and continues through life. Elementary school 
              children need memory enhancement and pattern recognition training. 
              This may be done by memorizing poems, bible verses, studying a 
              musical instrument, studying art along with the school curriculum.

              Middle School and Junior High School Preparation
            </h6>
            <p class="left-align">
              Middle and junior high school is a  critical time for the creation 
              of scholastic abilities.  Students at this time should be exposed 
              to a wide variety of subjects and activities. Care should be taken 
              to ensure the continued study of areas that enhance memory and 
              pattern recognition. Study activities should include English 
              grammar, writing, history, geography, general science, music, 
              art, shop activities, and lots of problem solving with arithmetic 
              and geometry. It should not include algebra until the ninth grade 
              or later.  There is enough material on problem solving using 
              arithmetic and geometry to provide interesting challenges to 
              students without introducing them to algebra. There are large 
              numbers of students in college who have missed these arithmetic 
              fundamentals and cannot combine two fractions.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Students who miss the fundamentals of arithmetic and problem 
              solving at this level are handicapped for life!

              High School Preparation
            </h6>
            <p class="left-align">
              High school success is largely dependent upon the ninth grade hump. 
              If students can get through the ninth grade with their enthusiasm 
              about learning intact, then the tenth grade will be fairly smooth. 
              The tenth grade is another transition period for urban high school 
              students. English grammar, algebra, geometry, and biology are the 
              most important subjects of the 10th grade. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Geometry is the sleeper subject at this time and its subtleties are 
              misunderstood by teachers almost universally. At this point in the 
              educational process, geometry is the subject that first introduces 
              formal inference schemes. Many teachers miss this point and so some 
              schools have introduced an informal geometry course, which is a 
              complete waste of time. Students should have a full year of formal 
              plane geometry. Algebra is the next most important subject in high 
              school mathematics as college preparation.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Calculus in high school is premature and I discourage it.  I find 
              that most of the students in my classes have trouble with arithmetic 
              and algebra. If students don't know the algebra, then their study of 
              calculus does not matter.  Some schools offer pre-calculus which is 
              better. However, high schools should focus on algebra, geometry,  
              trigonometry and solid geometry and leave the calculus for the 
              colleges.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Second year high school algebra is truly a must, as is English 
              composition, one year of biology,  chemistry, and physics.  
              Trigonometry and solid geometry should also be included in the 
              senior year.  Again, calculus in high school should be avoided.
