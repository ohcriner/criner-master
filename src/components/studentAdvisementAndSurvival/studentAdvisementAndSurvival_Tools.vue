              Probably the most important tool needed by the beginning  college 
              student is a computer This machine may not need to be the largest, 
              fastest, or most appointed device sold by the PC makers.

                  Students tell me that they can't afford a computer, but they have a 
                  car note.

              A standard computer in a mini-tower, a video display device, 
              and a printer can be obtained for a very reasonable price. Used 
              machines can be obtained cheaply.

              Most machines should have the professional version of the  
              Microsoft Office Suite, at a minimum. This software consists of a 
              word processor, Microsoft Word, the spreadsheet, EXCEL, and  the 
              database manager, MS ACCESS.     
            </p>
              <p class="left-align">
              There are several other applications in the Microsoft Office Suite 
              that are important to know and many very advanced capabilities that 
              will become useful as the student advances in college.
