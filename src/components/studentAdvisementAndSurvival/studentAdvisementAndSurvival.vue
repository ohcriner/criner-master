              would any other valuable asset. Learn how to maximize your return 
              on this investment. Take advantage of new knowledge about learning, 
              the importance of memory, critical thinking, and problem solving to

              in college are highly rewarded in the knowledge based economy.

              Most students entering college today are unprepared for the rigor 
              and discipline required by higher education. This means that most 
              will fall away during this journey. Success is guaranteed only to 
              those who persevere. We want our students to become successful in 
              their pursuits of higher education goals so that they are able to 
              be productive participants in the knowledge based economy. We want 
              to see you, finish college, graduate school, make money, and be 
              successful and contribute to society  as a reflection of your 
              efforts in higher education.

              Many students appear not to understand the big trends in the 
              society and how it will affect them and their lives in the future. 
              The scientific and technological developments in society mean that 
              the most demand for those people who can integrate these 
              developments into their working lives. The leaders of the 
              knowledge based society will be those people who have learned how 
              to learn and to do so faster and better than their competition.

              We want you to come into our industry, higher education. We need 
              teachers in colleges and universities and especially in the

              In the knowledge based economy, who is going to be more powerful 
              than those that have the knowledge and the ability to create 
              knowledge? Who will have more access to the resources of the 
              society? Our quality of life is affected by the way in which we 
              address these knowledge issues.
