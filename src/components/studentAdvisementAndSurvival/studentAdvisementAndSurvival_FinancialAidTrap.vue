              Financing higher education is and will continue to be a major issue 
              for most people. However, you should not let money prevent you from 
              going to college.

              If you really want a college education, there are ways to get your 
              education without having a great deal of money. However, these 
              methods require discipline, planning, and persistence on your part.

              Since those who attend college full-time should not work, the 
              classes are arranged at hours during the business day and, 
              generally, on alternate days, i.e., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 
              or Tuesday and Thursday.  This is one major difference between the 
              college environment and the and public school and trade school 
              environment. The reason for this style of class scheduling is 
              because learning is enhanced in a relaxed informal environment and 
              students are expected to do homework between classes. This is in 
              contrast to the technical school where classes are longer and more 
              concentrated and homework is generally not required. College 
              courses are intended to delve more deeply into subjects than 
              courses in technical schools. This may not always be true, in fact.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              The time required to be successful in college courses is an 
              unstated rule for success. The rule of thumb for most college 
              courses is that for every hour spent in class, the student should 
              spend three hours in study and preparation for the class. This is 
              increased for mathematics and science courses to 5 hours of study 
              and preparation. Computer science, engineering, and architecture 
              are probably the most time consuming courses of study with the out 
              of class preparation anywhere from five to ten hours per hour of 
              class time.      
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              A major difference between college and the technical school is that 
              for college students there is no enforcement  to ensure that the 
              amount of time allowed for preparation is actually spent in 
              preparation. College students are free to spend the time as they 
              wish.  How should college students spend their time?    
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Since there are only 168 hours in a week, i.e., 24 hours times 7 
              days, then students should take care in arranging their schedules 
              so that they maximize their learning potential.
