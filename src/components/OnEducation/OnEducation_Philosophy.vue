            <h5> The study of systems that describe human existence </h5>

                Human beings need to have an explanation of existence.  Most 
                human societies have creation stories that tell of the origin of 
                the people.  When a society does not have a creation story, it 
                will create one. Many groups of human beings are characterized 
                by their creation stories.  Most often creation stories describe 
                a relation with a supreme being as in the Adam and Eve story in 
                the Book of Genesis in the Christian Bible, Jewish Torah. The 
                depiction of Eve enticing Adam to eat from the tree of knowledge 
                has many subtle interpretations and implications in western 
                civilization.  
            </p>

                The Dogon elder, Ogotemelli, provided the French anthropologist, 
                Marcel Griaule, with the creation stories and other religious 
                rituals of the Dogon people.  The Dogon are one of many peoples 
                who stories challenge the prevailing views of human knowledge.  
                When the Dogon cosmology was published, there was a frenzy of 
                reaction to what appeared to be knowledge that could not have 
                been know by a people with no modern technology.

                Clearly, there is some confusion about how we know what we know, 
                or even if we know. The truth of a peoples creation story cannot 
                be challenged, since  the origin of the story is generally a 
                mystery.  Creation stories are not intended to be subjected to 
                the rigorous analysis of modern technology. They are intended 
                to satisfy a basic human need for logic and order in one life and 
                to answer the question, "Why am I here?"

                It is unfortunate that the study of philosophy has been taken out 
                of many college degree programs.  It is an enjoyable field of 
                study and I advise students to read widely and take as many 
                philosophy courses as possible, even if they are not in your 
                particular curriculum.
