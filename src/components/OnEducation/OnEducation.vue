              Modern science has long recognized that the common 
              conceptualizations of the functions of the mind are unsatisfactory, 
              if not down right misleading.  Educational methods based upon these 
              assumptions have led to untold misery and a failed public education 
              system.  I have found that most  educators have difficulty 
              reconciling the processes of knowing and understanding, so that it 
              is no wonder that students are confused and schools do not meet 
              expectations.

              Let me be exceedingly clear here.<i> Memory is the foundation of all 
              learning</i>. All memory is good memory, even "rote memory."  Too often 
              educators confuse understanding with knowing. The two concepts can 
              be separated. You can know and not understand, but you cannot 
              understand and not know.  Understanding comes after knowing. 
              Understanding depends upon knowing. This is the primary reason for 
              the failure of "new math."

            <p class="left-align">
             If  you understand a subject, then you must know it.  But, even more 
             importantly, you must know the processes of<i> explanation </i> in 
             the subject. Each subject has an inferential process that is used 
             to make conclusions in the subject. This inferential process must 
             also be memorized and practiced. If you can explain a subject using 
             the inferential processes of the subject, then you understand the 
             subject.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
             Repetition through practice is the method by which information is 
             implanted in animal memory. All animals learn in this manner. The 
             complexity of the processes being learned is what distinguishes 
             various animals. The ability to learn complex processes  is 
             dependent upon the species of the animal.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
             The enormous variation in the methods to achieve  memory is what 
             brings about the conclusion that people learn in different ways. 
             However, all of the ways result in information being imbedded in 
             memory.
