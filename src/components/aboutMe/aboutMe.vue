              This site is intended to help you succeed in college and introduce 
              you to the academic profession. I want to experience the joy of

              For me, scholarship is something you do because you must. You have 
              a curosity about all things. You want to know. You want to do. There 
              may be no other reason to study except that you want to know about 
              subject.

              Do not confuse higher education with job training. While employment 
              is one outcome of higher education, it should not be the focus of 
              your college career. However, for those who succeed at scholarship, 
              the rewards are very great.

              Teaching is what scholars do, but it is not all we do. We are also 
              entrepreneurs, writers, businesspersons, artists, musicians, 
              scientists, mathematicians, researchers,  and engaged in a host of 
              other endeavors.

              There is a critical shortage of  African American teachers and this 
              is especially true in  historically black colleges and universities.

                Teaching is a family tradition. Oscar H. Criner is a fourth 
                generation teacher in Texas. His great grandfather, A. J. Criner, 
                was an itinerant teacher who founded schools in Southeast Texas 
                after the civil war, including Lincoln High School in Port Arthur 
                and Charlton Pollard High School in Beaumont. Both his 
                grandmother and great aunt taught in Beaumont and Houston and his 
                parents taught in Mexia, Beaumont, and  Houston schools. His 
                sister Christine Criner-Smith was a principal high schools in 
                Texas and Caifornia. Dr. Criner has taught at Grambling College 
                in Louisiana, California State University at Hayward, and San 
                Francisco State University.
