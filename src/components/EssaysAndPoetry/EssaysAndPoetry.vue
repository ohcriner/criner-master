                These are personal investigations into a variety of subjects we 
                call knowledge. My objective is to explore frameworks for new 
                views of life processes and epistemologies that include the new 
                knowledge of who and what we are.

                It may be presumptuous to attempt a poetic description,<br>
                but with persistence and inspiration, it can be accomplished.

                My work has always been to attempt grand things;

            <p class="left-align">
                To see beyond seeing,<br>
                To know beyond knowing,<br>
                To love beyond loving.
            </p>

                Without knowing how big it is, seek to hold it.<br>
                Without knowing how far it is, go on the trip.<br>
                Without knowing how hard it is,  try to understand it.

                The distance from ignorance to knowledge is measured in persistence.<br>
                The distance from knowledge to wisdom is measured in failures.<br>
                To carry the knowledge requires a form<br>
                The search for a form  succeeds only after long periods of trying<br>
                Many forms are tried many times.<br>
                Practice is necessary as in all things.

                Poetry expands the literature.<br>
                Jazz expands the music.

                Explanations are sterile in scientific discourse.<br>
                Reductionist theories in science produce thousands of little analyses,<br>
                many are contradictory.

                Engineering has had limited success not withstanding the appearance of 
                tremendous achievement and great difficulty in their synthesis.

                The accumulation of great wealth in an age of abundance makes the 
                economic process an absurd game.

                Poetry is able to carry knowledge available no other way. Its 
                purpose is to explain the ineffable, the inexplicable,  the 
                indescribable

                It uses the nonlinearities of myth, mind, and image  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                When knowledge is considered in this way we understand the poets 
                and playwrights.

                Surely one does consider the plays of Beckett as history or 
                psychology or philosophy or art. They are somewhere in the 
                beyond; far out, if you will. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Euripides’ Medea is not history, but a human story. Shakespeare’s 
                history plays are not history, but plays on human stories in 
                history.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Strinberg’s plays are not psychology but plays that tell another 
                story about the human mind. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                The poet has no requirement to be true to the literal facts as 
                perceived by anyone.

                What freedom this gives to the honest poet.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                The poet creates a situation in the mind, a sequence of 
                statements in language, 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Where the images in language make the abstract concepts 
                understandable to a community of believers.

            <p class="left-align">
                We know to whom Homer was speaking. Virgil and Dante also had 
                specific audiences. So did Shakespeare, Milton, and St. Augustine.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                But poetry is not used to present the grand schema today.

                Our scholars submit to the excesses of the logical positivists.
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Most have no real understanding of the uses and limitations of 
                science or logic.

            <p class="left-align">
                So we are reduced to the literature of reaction; of concepts, 
                dreams and images from StarTrek and StarWars.

                We pursue Mars when we should pursue Earth.

                Instead, we should be bold and begin a new epistemology.

            <p class="left-align">
                A worldview that is derived from the most ancient roots of humanity.

                Scholars, strive to present the story to your people that is 
                honest with your knowledge of science.
