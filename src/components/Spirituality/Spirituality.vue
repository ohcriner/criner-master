                For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, 
                says the LORD. As high as the heavens are above the earth, so 
                high are my ways above your ways and my thoughts above your 
                thoughts. Isaiah 55:8-9

                This is clearly a statement of how much human beings can know. It is
                a profound statement of epistemology. It places a limit on what human
                beings can know and understand. It destroys forever the naieve notion
                that everything can be known with enough research.
