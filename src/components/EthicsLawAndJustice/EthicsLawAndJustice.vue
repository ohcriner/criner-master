                The American Jury -- We the people in action!

                Many scandals have been prominent in the news for the past several 
                years. Dr. Criner served as a member of the jury for the criminal 
                trial of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. This trial was 
                significant because it was one of the few instances where the 
                federal government brought a criminal indictment against a 
                prominent  major company in the United States.

                This was the lead-off case for a series of corporate scandals 
                that precipitated what has become the first great scandal induced 
                recession of the twentieth-first century. The revelation of a 
                level of corporate corruption unparalleled in society caused an 
                extremely rapid flight of capital from the markets.  How could 
                investors have confidence in their investments when the 
                fundamental information upon which they based their decisions had 
                been corrupted? The extent to which the institutions of American 
                society were subverted for personal gain is shocking.

                Even to persons familiar with the history of American 
                capitalism, it was clear that these business people had gone too 
                far. They had exceeded the limits of propriety granted by a 
                society that favors business. They had played the game by 
                stretching the rules and not the spirit. But even worse, they had 
                construed the rules to benefit their profit motives. They 
                co-opted and subverted political, philanthropic, and academic 
                institutions in their thrust to gain higher profits and personal 
                wealth out of all proportion.  They stretched the ethics and  
                pushed the limits of the letter of the law  in order to 
                perpetrate their crimes and escape justice.
