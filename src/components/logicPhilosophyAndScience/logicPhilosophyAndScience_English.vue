             Probably the most important skills for serious college students to 
             develop, even before mathematics,  are reading, writing, and 
             speaking. Everything that is called knowledge depends upon the 
             written and spoken language. You learn how to read by reading, to 
             write by writing, and to speak by speaking. Practice, practice, 
             practice and more practice is necessary for the development of 
             excellent literary skills.   
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
             College curricula  usually require two years of English courses, 
             one year of grammar and one of literature and writing. Some may 
             have a semester of public speaking included. This is rarely ever 
             sufficient for most people. Students should seek to enhance their 
             literary skills through courses that require writing and through 
             extracurricular activities. Working on the college newspaper will 
             enhance writing skills. Joining the drama club and being active in 
             plays will enhance your memory and speaking skills. Being active in 
             the debate club will enhance your ability at rhetoric and verbal 
             argument. Studying  writers, especially those held up as especially 
             good models, will help writing skills.  
            </p>

              Complex ideas are always communicated  in writing. In the knowledge 
              based economy, writing is an economic process.  All progress in  
              science and technology depends upon persons who can write clearly 
              and lucidly.  Scientific explanations of phenomena , i.e.,  
              theories, are expressed in the language of ordinary discourse.

             Another well kept secret of the academic world is that problem 
             solving requires more writing  than mathematics. Software 
             development is creative writing. This is one of the most 
             misunderstood areas of the current technology. Problems solved 
             using science and engineering are first described in writing before 
             they are solved in any scientific or  engineering procedure or 
             computer program.
