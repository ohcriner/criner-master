              Logical holistic view of knowledge where literature is the 
              common unifying subject. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               One of the most startling facts that the serious scholar will 
               discover in the pursuit of excellence is that all fields of 
               knowledge are essentially the same. They all have the same basic 
               structure. The differences between the subjects are generally in 
               the vocabulary and the inferential scheme. Some subjects require 
               physical dexterity but they all require practice in the processes 
               of the subject. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
               The reason that all subjects are the same is that they are 
               expressed in the literature of a sequential language. The 
               characteristics of a sequential language are inherited by the 
               subject that is expressed in it. It is for this reason that 
               English and mathematics are essentially the same. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              The fundamental questions of education have been studied and 
              written about by philosophers for thousands of years. The essence 
              of the problem is one of communication from one human being to 
              another human being.  In other words, how do we tell the story? 
              The issues can be summarized as follows: 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
             <ol>
               <li>
                 What do we know and how do we know it?
               </li>
               <li>
                 How do we understand what we know? 
               </li>
               <li>
                 How do we explain what we understand?
               </li>
             </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
              Of course, the obvious next question is, "Is there knowledge that 
              cannot be expressed in a sequential language?" I believe that there 
              is such knowledge, but do not worry about it; it will not be on any 
              written examination!
