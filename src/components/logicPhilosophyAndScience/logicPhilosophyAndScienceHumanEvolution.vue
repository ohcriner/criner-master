            <p class="left-align">
                Almost all of anthropology and history has to be recast in the 
                light of scientific proof of the connection of all humanity to a 
                population of humans who originated in Africa.  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Black scholars have long known that the origin of man was Africa 
                and of the obvious  direct connection with black people 
                everywhere. The connection with white people and other people of 
                color was less obvious, but known. The oldest known fossils were 
                found in Africa by Richard Leakey. The DNA trail was followed and 
                described by Spencer Wells in his book<i> The Journey of Man.</i>    
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                We now have scientific proof of one species of  homo sapiens 
                populating all continents of the world. There is a direct genetic 
                connection that connects aboriginals Africans and aboriginal 
                Australians. So how did the Africans get to Australia? The answer 
                is obvious, they walked. The question that had to be answered was 
                "Under what conditions could you walk from Africa to Australia?" 
                The answer requires that the accepted anthropological time scale  
                and climatological theory be changed. The climate must  have been 
                hospitable enough to allow people to move relatively unclothed 
                through the world. 
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                Scientist have known for a very long time that " the normal 
                climate of geological times was comparatively warm, with few 
                extremes of temperature. Polar latitudes were cool - temperate, 
                with open seas, and a reduced albedo  (index of reflection of 
                radiation from the earth's surface)  in the absence of snow or 
                ice." [1]  In 1955,  Immanuel Velikovsky wrote of fossils of  
                palms trees found in Greenland, corals in Alaska, bones of the 
                hippopotamus in England and France, and polar bears and artic 
                foxes found with ostriches and crocodiles. In fact, Velikovsky 
                cites evidence that the levels of the worlds oceans have varied; 
                sharply in the recent geological past, within the timeframe of 
                early human beings.[2]  
            </p>
            <p class="left-align">
                 Lower levels of the oceans means that many land masses currently 
                 under water could have provided a continuous trail from Africa to 
                 Australia. The islands in the southeastern Pacific must have been 
                 connected. The Arabian Peninsular and the African Continent were 
                 connected. North Africa was probably connected to Europe in 
                 several places and there was no Strait of Gibraltar. A. Berthelot 
                 states that "It is possible that stone age man witnessed in 
                 Africa three notable events: the sinking of the Spanish-Atlas 
                 chain that open the Strait of Gibraltar  and created the junction 
                 between the Mediterranean Sea and the ocean; the collapse that 
                 cut off the canary Islands from the African Continent; the 
                 opening of the Strait of  Bab-el-Mandeb, separating Arabia from 
                 Ethiopia." [3]
