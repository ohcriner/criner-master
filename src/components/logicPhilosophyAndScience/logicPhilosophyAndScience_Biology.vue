                Biology is a fundamental subject. What could be more fascinating 
                than studying the life process? Biology is the foundation 
                required for understanding the life processes. Knowing and 
                understanding the life processes are necessary for preserving it. 
                Otherwise, it will be destroyed or changed is unexpected ways by 
                uncontrolled pollution and abuse of the natural resources.

                New results in biology are having tremendous impact upon human 
                activities, medicine, science and the view of humanity generally. 
                There is probably no other field that is a rich in the potential 
                for establishing new knowledge today as is biology. Where the 
                20th Century was the era of the physicist, computer scientist, 
                and  mathematician, the 21st Century will be the era of the 
                biologist. In particular, it will be the era of the quantitative 
                biologist, who understands mathematics, computing, as well as the 
                other sciences. In this new biology, scientists will be concerned 
                with delving into the fundamental nature of the life process 
                itself.

                The "new synthesis" of the biological, physical, and social 
                sciences is changing the manner in which human beings are viewed. 
                We now know that biology has much more influence over the behavior 
                of human beings that ever thought before. The development of  
                computational models of complex biological phenomena is the 
                cutting edge today. This knowledge will have tremendous impact 
                on the structure and behavior of human organizations and practices. 
                Think of  Star Trek and "Mr. Data" and you will begin to see a 
                vision of the future of this research. It is as exciting as going 
                to the moon.
