             History is a grand adventure story. It is an integrated story, a 
             holistic story, with emphasis on the "whole." All of the people of 
             the world are included in  "World History" and it  is one of the most 
             important college subjects. We live in a global society and have much 
             more interaction with people from around the world than at any other 
             time in history.  Colleges generally have a course or two in history 
             in the core curricula. What is truly important is to develop an 
             understanding and an appreciation of  all the peoples of the world  
             and their civilizations.  Find the course that covers world 
             civilizations and take it.

             The United States of America is a special place whose development 
             is unparalleled in history. But the United States did not and could 
             not have developed in a vacuum. It had to interact with the rest of 
             the world.  Students must know about this interaction both from our 
             perspective and from the perspective of the other peoples of the 
             world.

              History is the study of what happened in the past as a set of facts 
              and as the context for the interpretation of those facts. The 
              context of history is a logical system that established the 
              capability to answer the question "Why?" about a historical 
              situation. The answer to the question "Why?" is a statement of the 
              type "Because..." The "Why ... Because" inferential scheme depends 
              upon the assumptions that  are made about the processes of history.  
              Those assumptions  have been the cause of  untold war and 
              devastation.

                    Are the processes of history simply the result of the actions

               History is probably the result of all of these influences, 
               which is what makes history such a complex subject.
