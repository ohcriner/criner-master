Consider what \n               would happen it the professional athletic companies obtained a \n               patient on the growth factors for the optimal configuration of \n               the athlete. If you want an Einstein, then administer hormones \n               to enhance memory. If your unborn child is diagnosed to be \n               anticephallic, then its organs will be harvested for medical \n               purposes.  For black people the potential for mischief from \n               genetic engineering far surpass the domesticated breeding, \n               lynching, torture or any of the other horrors of which \n               plantation owners could dream. \n          ")]),a("p",{staticClass:"left-align"},[e._v('\n              It seems clear to me that the current philosophical foundations \n              of society are grossly incapable of addressing contemporary \n              issues concerning the use and limitations of science and \n              technology. Political and religious leaders are confused and \n              cannot reconcile single parent families, surrogate motherhood, \n              homosexuality, gay marriage, and serial, polyandrous, or \n              polygamous marriage with their teachings. How will they ever \n              address genetic engineering? These problems lie embedded in the \n              major dichotomy of western philosophy, the old mind-body problem, \n              again. The mind-body dichotomy has led to the separation between \n              science and the arts and humanities. C. P. Snow described this \n              situation as the "two cultures." If these new technologies are to \n              be mollified and made humane for all people, there must be a \n              reunification of knowledge of science and the humanities; and a \n              new integration of knowledge with the religious. \n          ')])])])])])])])}],Qi=(n("U2xy"),{}),Xi=Object(h["a"])(Qi,Vi,Zi,!1,null,"e0dca55e",null),es=Xi.exports;a["a"].use(U["a"]);var ts=new
